delicious_tags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project shows how you can use the Delicious API to retrieve the most frequent tags
associated with any URL. This can be very useful for categorizing sites or pages within
your application.

To use it, just call get_tags_for_url() and you'll get back an associative array of the
top ten tags for that address, and how often each tag was used.

The test_page.php example shows how to use the function, or to see a live demo, go to
